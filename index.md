# Welcome to My Personal Site

> [!WARNING]
> This site is under construction.
I absolutely hate how boring this looks. I have nothing against nerds, but this is too much. The only reason it doesn't look cooler is because I am witholding myself from working on it. It will othwerwise undermine become a procrastination tool.

## About Me

Hello, I'm Chinmay. 

I'm a PhD Student based in London. I am a `systems biologist`, with a background in physics. I love the hum of a well engineered complex machine, right now looking at that in biological systems.

I am also a [web developer](#web-projects). I've been building the web since 2018, initially using MEAN stack, now using SvelteKit.

I do play the flute - carnatic music.

Mainly from peer pressure, I am starting to [read](#reading).

Ocasionaly, I write - topics have no theme.
